### Changed

- Renaming plugin directories to match Statick's directory structure.
- Upgraded version of markdownlint-cli used in Actions to the latest available.
- For testing with Actions, the installed version of Node was upgraded from v10 to v14.
  Node v10 is no longer supported.
  Node v14 is recommended by the developers as it is a long-term support (LTS) release.

### Removed

- Remove testing support for Ubuntu 16.04 and Python 3.5.
  There is no guarantee Statick will work in those environments any longer.

## v0.0.7 - 2021-01-22

This is expected to be the final release that supports Python 3.5.
Ubuntu 16.04 has reached end-of-life status.
The final release of ROS Kinetic has been made.
See <https://github.com/sscpac/statick/discussions/290> for a discussion on Python 3.5 support in Statick.

### Changed

- Turned off line length checks for Markdown code blocks.

### Added

- Using type hints as introduced in Python 3.5 and improved in Python 3.6.
  Type hints are described in [PEP 438](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/)
  and [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
  They provide static typing for methods and variables.
  The use of mypy is encouraged to look for errors in expected types.

### Removed

- No longer supporting pypy3 due to issues with type hints and mypy.

## v0.0.5 - 2020-12-22

### Added
